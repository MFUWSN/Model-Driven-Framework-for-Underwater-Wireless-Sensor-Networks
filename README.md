# MFUWSN Transormation Engine for Underwater Wireless Sensor Network (UWNS) Applications 
Model-Driven Research Project Repository
This is a repository for MFUWSN (Model Driven framework for UWSN Applications) transformation engine. The transformation engine is capable of automatically generating CC code from high level MFUWSN source models which can then be deployed to underwater simulation environment.
